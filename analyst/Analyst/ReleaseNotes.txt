A few notes about Analyst:
This is a tool that allows you to look at signalsin QVRT files in detail
You can use the controls to zoom in both in time and frequency space
You can also examine signals in the time domain 
When you load a QVRT file for the first time, Analyst will generate an index file for easier viewing

Installation:
	This application is both a WBT application and a Debian-flavored Desktop application
	For the WBT, install it as any other WPK. 
	For Ubuntu Dev VM, simply unzip the folder and create a desktop link to the executable.

There are a few know bugs / shortcomings in the App
	-Sometimes it crashes - it hasn't been through QA yet
	-Combined Band viewing may or may not work for you

If you encounter errors, try deleting the .idx file of the QVRT file
Please report any issues / bugs to me and I will try to address them in future releases.

Enjoy!
