This library is a collection of code that I've developed from several previous applicaitons
Instead of simply copying the code from project to project, this is my attempt
to formalize it to better carry it forward


Dependencies:
LiquidSDR
QVRT_Tool
OpenCV
QT
Intel performance primitives


We need some sort of library class / object that can:
Take a ftmarker, input filename and output file name
Resample and filter on the FT marker and put the info in a new file
use the output file name store meta-data

targets for ipp replacement:
resampler
resampler_arb
resampler_ff
